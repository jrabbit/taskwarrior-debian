task (2.3.0+dfsg-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Update git URL in the get-orig-source script.
  * Use dh-buildinfo:
    + Update debian/rules.
    + Add the package to Build-Depends.
  * Add DEP-8 tests that run adequate(1) against the packages.
  * Add patch (tests-count-eom.diff) to make the count.t test failures on the
    last day of the month non-fatal (closes: #743238). Thanks to James
    Dietrich for the bug report and the analysis of the problem.
  * Remove a long obsolete comment from debian/rules.
  * Drop tests-unset-env-vars.diff, as the problem of test suite stomping on
    user's data has been fixed upstream.
    Set TASKDATA and TASKRC to specially-crafted values (both in debian/rules
    and in the DEP-8 test), so that task trips over it if the problem
    reappears in the future 
  * Mark tests-fail.diff as forwarded upstream.

    missing.

    + Update system-kfreebsd.diff; partially applied upstream.
    + Update system-hurd.diff; partially applied upstream.
    + Add patch (no-path-max.diff) to use get_current_dir_name() instead of
      relying on PATH_MAX, as the latter is not defined on GNU/Hurd.
  * Add code to remove pre-built static libraries to debian/rules; the static
    libraries are back in .orig.tar…
  * Adapt the test suite to Debian needs:
    + Update tests-for-released-version.diff to allow running tests against a
      beta version of taskwarrior.

  * Disable GnuTLS support for the time being.

task (2.2.0-4) experimental; urgency=low

  * Fix a typo in the copyright file.
  * Update years in the copyright file.
  * Bump standards version to 3.9.5 (no changes needed).
  * Replace patch to hardcode Debian-specific paths (debian-paths.diff) with a
    cleaner patch (customizable-rcdir.diff) that makes TASK_RCDIR customizable
    at configure time. Update deban/rules to set TASK_DOCDIR and TASK_RCDIR at
    configure time.
  * Rename the binary package: task → taskwarrior (closes: #719317).
    Thanks to Ben Armstrong for the bug report.
    + Rename the main package as “taskwarrior” in debian/control; add
      Conflicts/Replaces against the old “task” package.
    + Add transitional package to debian/control.
    + Move Pre-Depends to the transitional package.
    + Rename debhelper configuration files.
    + Update debian/rules and README.Debian accordingly.

      compatibility.

      directory to symlink.

      transitioning /usr/share/task from directory to symlink slightly easier.

    static libraries are no longer shipped in .orig.tar.

  * Stop dh_compress from compressing examples.
  * Refresh patches.
  * Add “XS-Testsuite: autopkgtest”.

    (closes: #710321):
    + Update debian/rules accordingly.
    + Add debian/maintscript to let dh_installdeb add maintainer script
      snippets to remove the old file.
    + Bump minimum required version of debhelper to 8.1 (for
      dpkg-maintscript-helper support.)
    + Add ${misc:Pre-Depends} to Pre-Depends. (It's not strictly necessary for
      unstable, but it eases wheezy backports).
  * Add DEP-8 tests.

task (2.2.0-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Upload to unstable.
  * Adapt the test suite to Debian needs:
    + Add patch (tests-set-build-type.diff) to set cmake build type to ‘debug’
      and append -Wall to CXXFLAGS. That way tests are built with the same
      flags as normal code.

    + Add patch (tests-fail.diff) to make the test runner exit with non-zero
      code if any of the tests fail.
    + Add patch (tests-for-released-version.diff) to allow running tests
      against a released version of taskwarrior.
    + Add patch (tests-temporary-directory.diff) to fix insecure use of /tmp.
  * Run tests at build time.
    + Update debian/rules.
    + Add libjson-perl to Build-Depends.
  * Add patch (directory-no-path-max.diff) to use get_current_dir_name()

    + Drop "cbds" from Build-Depends.

  * Add patch (fix-manpage-installation.diff) to fix manual page installation
